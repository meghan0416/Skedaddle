Created in 2017 using Google's Cardboard SDK for Unity.

Skedaddle is a Google Cardboard VR game based on the theme words Anxious, Shy, and Introverted. With these words in mind, the object of the game is to run from a crowd of people desperately trying to throw you a surprise birthday party â€” but it's not even your birthday! Dodge obstacles by tilting your head left and right and try to get home in one piece. This was my first time coding in Unity.
